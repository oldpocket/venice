<chapter name="Equations">
<para>You can store commonly used functions like indicators, so you do not
need to retype them. Once an equation is stored, you can access it from
any equation entry field by clicking on the small down arrow, which
appears next to all the equation entry fields. It will then display a list
of your stored equations.</para>

<para>You do not need to go to preferences to add, edit or delete stored equations.
Each equation entry field will display a menu if you right click on it.
It will give you the options to <highlight>Add</highlight>, <highlight>Edit</highlight>, <highlight>Delete</highlight>,
or <highlight>Manage</highlight>. Most of these options are self-explanatory; Manage
will display the equations preferences page.</para>

<para>You have to write the equations according to the English localization.
For example you cannot write a number inside an equation as 17,17
(with comma as decimal separator). Instead you must write it as 17.17
(with point as decimal separator), regardless of the localization you're using.
This rule applies only to equations; all other numbers in Venice follow
the selected localization.</para>

<para>You can reach the equations page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then selecting the <highlight>Equations</highlight> page.
</item>
</list>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Language">
<para>You can change the default language and use a different Venice localisation.</para>
<para>You can reach the language configuration page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.

</item>
</list>

<para>When you change the localisation language, you should restart Venice,
so that all menus are refreshed.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Macros">
<para>Venice supports the execution of Jython macros. Jython macros are scripts
written in the Python language that can call internal Venice functions.</para>
<para>You can reach the macros configuration page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then selecting the <highlight>Macro</highlight> page.
</item>
</list>
<para>This page enables you to enter the macros. Writing macros involves
knowledge of Python scripts, the Java language, and the ability to use
Venice's provided JavaDoc API.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Proxy">
<para>You can configure Venice to work with a web proxy. This allows
you to download quotes from the Internet through a web proxy. You can reach
the proxy configuration page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then selecting the <highlight>Proxy</highlight> page.
</item>
</list>
<para>To use the proxy, make sure the <highlight>Use Proxy</highlight> check box is
selected and enter the proxy host and port into the two fields.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Quote Source">
<para>When Venice is running, it needs to access quotes from a local source. It
cannot work directly with quotes from the internet. Venice does support
downloading quotes from the internet, but you need to store them locally
before they can be used. Venice currently supports three local quote sources.
You can store your quotes in an external database (MySQL, PostgreSQL and
HSQLDB are tested, but other databases should also work), an internal
database automatically set up by Venice (HSQLDB) or you can work with the
sample quotes provided.</para>
<para>The best way of storing your quotes is to set up an external database.
This provides the best performance. However, using the internal database
is extremely easy because it requires no setup. The sample quotes are only
provided as a demonstration.</para>
<para>You can reach the quote source configuration page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then selecting the <highlight>Quote Source</highlight> page.
</item>
</list>
<section name="Samples">
<para>Venice has some inbuilt sample quotes, so you can test Venice without
going to all the trouble of importing stock quotes. It contains a small
selection of quotes from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) from 1986. Venice
will default to using the sample quotes when you run it for the first time.</para>
</section>
<section name="Internal">
<para>Venice supports storing quotes in an internal database. This does not
provide particularly good performance, but requires no setup. Venice will
default to using the sample quotes when you run it for the first time, but
as soon as you try to import quotes, it will switch to the internal database.
So you don't need to select this option manually. If you wish to change from
another quote source specifically, once you have reached the quote source
page, click on the <highlight>Internal</highlight> tab and select the <highlight>Use Internal</highlight> radio button.</para></section>
<section name="Database">
<para>Once you have played with Venice for a while you might get annoyed at the time
it takes Venice to load quotes from the internal database. You can fix this by
reading quotes from an external database. Currently Venice is only tested
with MySQL, PostgreSQL and HSQLDB, but other databases (SQL) should also work. To read
quotes from an external database, you'll need to download a copy of the
database software and the relevant Java software driver (JDBC) that lets Venice
talk to the database. However, if you use MySQL, then you do not need to
download the Java software driver, as that is already included in Venice.</para>

<para>You can download MySQL from http://www.mysql.com. Once the database is
set up you'll need to create a database for Venice. Call the database
<highlight>shares</highlight>.</para>
<para>Next you'll need to configure Venice to use the database.
From the quote source page, to tell Venice to read quotes from an external
database click on the <highlight>Database</highlight> tab and select the <highlight>Use Database</highlight>
radio button. You'll be presented with several fields you need to fill in:</para>
<list><item><highlight>Database</highlight> - Select the database software that you are using.
</item>
<item><highlight>Driver</highlight> - Select the JDBC database driver software.
</item>

<item><highlight>Host</highlight> - This is the IP address of the computer that the database is
      running on. If it is running on the same machine as Venice, you can just
      put <highlight>localhost</highlight> or <highlight>127.0.0.1</highlight> here if you want.
</item>
<item><highlight>Port</highlight> - This is the port that the database is listening on.
      You shouldn't need to touch this.
</item>
<item><highlight>Username</highlight> - This is the user name that Venice will connect with in
      the database. You should have created a user/password pair when setting
      up the database.
</item>
<item><highlight>Password</highlight> - This is the password that Venice will connect with in
      the database. You should have created a user/password pair when setting
      up the database.
</item>
<item><highlight>Database Name</highlight> - This is the name of the database that you created
      earlier. You shouldn't need to touch this.
</item>

<item><highlight>Show Prompt to Enter Password</highlight> - Check this option if you'd prefer not to store the database password on disk. When this option is checked, Venice will prompt you to enter the password for the database when the database is accessed for the first time.</item>
</list>
<para>Finally you'll need to import the quotes into the database, you can do this by
using the <link to="Importing Quotes">Import Quotes</link> dialog.</para>
<para>Good luck!</para>
<para>Venice will automatically create the necessary database tables. For
reference, this is the format of the table created:</para>
<para><codeblock>+--------+----------+------+-----+------------+-------+
| Field  | Type     | Null | Key | Default    | Extra |
+--------+----------+------+-----+------------+-------+
| date   | date     |      | PRI | 0000-00-00 |       |
| symbol | char(12) |      | PRI |            |       |
| open   | float    | YES  |     | 0          |       |
| close  | float    | YES  |     | 0          |       |
| high   | float    | YES  |     | 0          |       |
| low    | float    | YES  |     | 0          |       |
| volume | int(11)  | YES  |     | 0          |       |
+--------+----------+------+-----+------------+-------+
</codeblock></para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Index Definition">
<para>The index page allows a user to manage the list of symbols which are also
indeces. Venice treats indeces slightly differently. (For example, when Venice displays the point change for an index, but treats it as an ordinary stock, the point change will be out by a couple of orders of magnitude). </para>
<para>The user is responsible for maintaining those symbols which are indeces. To define a symbol as a new index, press the 'Add' button. A new dialog appears with fields for the stock code and the index name. Enter the symbol, and optionally the name of the index. </para>
<para>After pressing ok, Venice will treat the symbol as an index.</para>
<para>To remove an index definition, select the index stock code and press the 'Delete' button.</para>

</chapter>

<chapter name="Tuning">
<para>The tuning page allows you to configure Venice for optimal performance.</para>
<para>You can reach the tuning configuration page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then selecting the <highlight>Tuning</highlight> page.
</item>
</list>

<para>Loading quotes can sometimes take a while. For this reason Venice
caches the quotes it reads in. That is, it keeps them in memory so that if you
want to view them again, they come up much faster. By default Venice keeps up
to about 100,000 quotes in memory at one time. On this page you can view the
number of quotes Venice is currently caching and set the maximum amount. From
time to time, Venice may need to go a little higher than this amount.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter name="User Interface">
<para>The user interface page allows you to enable some optional features as well as configure how Venice shows information.</para>
<para>You can reach the user interface configuration page by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Preferences</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then selecting the <highlight>User Interface</highlight> page.
</item>
</list>

<para>You can specify the minimum and maximum number of decimal digits which can be shown. So for example
if you want to display the number 12.1234567 and you obtain the following strings according to minimum and
maximum values:</para>
<list>
<item>Minimum 3, Maximum 7 -> 12.1234567.
</item>
<item>Minimum 3, Maximum 5 -> 12.12345.
</item>
<item>Minimum 7, Maximum 8 -> 12.1234567.
</item>
<item>Minimum 8, Maximum 8 -> 12.12345670.
</item>
</list>

<para>When you change the above parameters, you should restart Venice,
so that these parameters are effective.</para>

<para>You can also save the state of windows which are open when you exit Venice so that they are restored the next time you run Venice. To turn on the restore feature, click the "tick" box. Note that for table windows, currently the entire table is saved. For large tables this can take a long time and use up a lot of storage. </para>

</chapter>

<chapter name="Chart Defaults">
<para>The Chart Defaults page currently only allows you to set which chart type will be displayed initially when you graph a stock. The default is set to Line Chart initially.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Importing End of Day Quotes">
<para>Before you import quotes, you might want to decide (but don't have to worry
about it now if you dont't want to!) whether to use an internal or external
database. If you don't want to think about this now, then Venice will
automatically switch to using an internal database when you import quotes
for the first time. See <link to="Quote Source">Quote Source</link> for more information.</para>
<para>You can reach the import quotes dialog by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu.

either files or the internet.</para>

<section name="Importing End of Day Quotes from Files">
<para>To import end of day quotes from files, open the import end of day quotes dialog
and click on <highlight>Files</highlight>. This allows you to import multiple quote files
in one operation. Importing quotes can take a while, so please be patient. You
need to select the quote type you are importing, see <link to="Quote Source">Quote Source</link> for an explanation of these types.
When you click <highlight>Import</highlight> a dialog will come up and you can select
multiple quote files using the shift or the control key to select multiple

<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>File</highlight> menu.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Sync</highlight> menu.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Intra-day Quotes</highlight> menu item.
</item>
</list>
<para>This dialog lets you instruct Venice to periodically download the current
intra-day quotes from the internet. Once enabled, Venice will periodically poll
an Internet site every few seconds or minutes and download the latest quote
values. Currently intra-day quotes are only used in the Watch Screens.</para>

<para>To enable intra-day quote synchronisation, you'll need to fill in the following
fields:</para>
<list><item><highlight>Enabled</highlight> - Select this to enable intra-day quote synchronisation.
</item>
<item><highlight>Source</highlight> - Select the Internet site to download the quotes. Currently only
Yahoo Finance is supported.
</item>

<item><highlight>Symbols</highlight> - Write in a comma or a space separated listed of symbols
that should always be downloaded by Venice. This does not mean that if you don't
list a symbol here it won't be downloaded. All symbols will be downloaded when
they are specified for the first time, this just lets you specify some symbols in advance so that Venice can automatically start downloading the quote's day history.
Since intra-day charting is currently not supported, this field has little
value.
</item>
<item><highlight>Open Time</highlight> - This is the time that your exchange opens.
</item>
<item><highlight>Close Time</highlight> - This is the time that your exchange closes.
</item>
<item><highlight>Period</highlight> - This is the period (in seconds) between quote

<para>What if the string <highlight>mm</highlight>, <highlight>dd</highlight>, <highlight>MMM</highlight> or <highlight>yy</highlight> appears in my
destination file but it isn't meant to be part of the date string? Well it won't
work.</para>
<para>The export feature will export all stored quotes. There is no way of telling
Venice to only export a specific date range.</para>
</chapter></chapter>

<chapter name="Tables">
<para>Venice has the ability to list quote prices for a single day's trading in a
table, and the ability to list all quote prices for a list of given stocks.
When listing you need to decide which stocks you are interested in. Currently
you can select from <highlight>All Ordinaries</highlight>, <highlight>Market Indices</highlight> and <highlight>All Symbols</highlight>.
These categories are based on the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) so might not
be very relevant for other exchanges. Currently Venice is very ASX-centric. At
the moment Venice does not have access to any data relating to the symbols it
is given, so it has to guess which category the symbol falls in. All
Ordinaries lists all 3 letter symbols except those starting with an <emphasis>X</emphasis>.
Market Indices lists all symbols starting with an <emphasis>X</emphasis>, on
the ASX almost all of these are market indices. All Symbols lists all the
symbols.</para>

<para>You can display a table by doing the following:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>Table</highlight> menu.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on either <highlight>All Ordinaries</highlight>, <highlight>Market Indices</highlight>,
      <highlight>All Stocks</highlight> or <highlight>Stocks</highlight>.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on either <highlight>List All</highlight>, <highlight>List By Date</highlight>, <highlight>List By Rule</highlight> or
      <highlight>List By Symbols</highlight>.
</item>
</list>

<para>The <highlight>List All</highlight> option allows you to list all the stock quotes
on the given date.</para>

<para>The <highlight>List By Date</highlight> option allows you to specify the date of the stock
quotes to list.</para>

<para>The <highlight>List By Rule</highlight> option allows you to specify the initial
filter. The filter is an equation which specifies which stocks should be
listed and which hidden, see below for more details about this, also see the
<link to="Gondola Language">Gondola Language</link> for details about the format of
the equations.</para>

<para>The <highlight>List By Symbols</highlight> option allows you to specify the stock symbols
to list. Then all the quotes for those stock symbols will be listed.</para>

<section name="Apply Equations">
<para>You can run multiple equations against every stock listed in the table and
list the result of the equation. Click on the <highlight>Table</highlight> menu, then
click on the <highlight>Apply Equations</highlight> menu item. This will bring up a dialog
where you can enter up to 5 equations that can be run against each stock. For
each you can enter the name of the column and the equation to be run. See
<link to="Gondola Language">Gondola Language</link> for details about the format of these equations.
Also see <link to="Preferences">Preferences</link> for how to get Venice to remember equations
so you don't have to keep typing them in all the time. To get you started, an
example equation is <code>avg(close, 30, 0)</code> which will calculate the average
day close value over the last 30 days, including today.</para>
</section>

<section name="Apply Filter">
<para>You can restrict which stocks are listed in the table by setting up an equation
filter. This equation is run against each stock listed in the table, if the
equation equates to true for a stock, then that stock is listed. Otherwise it
is hidden. You can reach this by clicking on the <highlight>Apply Filter</highlight> menu item.
Again, see <link to="Gondola Language">Gondola Language</link> for details about the format of these equations.
Also see <link to="Preferences">Preferences</link> for how to get Venice to remember equations so
you don't have to keep typing them in all the time. To get you started, an
example equation filter is <code>lag(close, 0) > lag(close, -1)</code> which will
list all quotes where the day close of today is higher than the day close of
the last trading day.</para>
</section>

<section name="General Table Features">
<para>Every table in Venice supports the following:</para>

<para>By clicking on a column header you can sort by that column, click again and
you reverse the sort. You can change the order of the columns by dragging a
column and dropping it into a new position.</para>

<para>Some tables in Venice support the following:</para>
<para>By right clicking on a row you can raise a context sensitive menu. If you
double click on a row the most common operation is invoked, typically
Graphing. Some tables also have a menu item <highlight>Show Columns</highlight> which lets
you specify which columns are shown.</para>
</section>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Watch Screens">
<para>Watch screens provide a way to monitor the value of a group of stocks. Watch
screens can be created using any stocks, and any indicator can be applied to the
stocks. Venice supports both intra-day and end of day watch screens. If Venice
is currently downloading intra-day quotes, it will display the latest quotes,
otherwise it will display the latest end of day quotes. You can create a new
watch screen by doing the following:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>Table</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Watch Screen</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>New Watch Screen</highlight> menu item.
</item>
</list>
<para>This will create a new watch screen which you will need to name. You
can then add symbols that should be displayed in this watch screen.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter name="Graphs">
<section name="Portfolio Graphs">
<para>You can graph the value of any portfolio over time by doing the following:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>Graph</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Portfolio</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the name of the portfolio you wish to graph.
</item>
</list>

<para>Depending on the size of your portfolio and the time it has existed, this
might take a while as Venice has to load in stock quotes for every stock
traded for every day of the portfolio.</para>

<para>Apart from graphing the value of the portfolio over time, you can also graph
the profit/loss of the portfolio. To do this, graph the portfolio as above,
then click on the menu item with the same name as your portfolio, then select
the <highlight>Graph</highlight> menu item and then click on <highlight>Profit/Loss</highlight>. The profit and loss
graph is calculated by ignoring any deposits and withdrawals made to the
portfolio, the balance of that portfolio over time will reflect the profit and
loss made.</para>

<para>A market indicator is an indicator that can be used to help determine the
state of the market. They are calculated using multiple stocks on the market,
for example <highlight>Advance/Decline</highlight> uses all ordinary stocks in its calculations.</para>

<section name="Advance/Decline">
<para>Currently the only market indicator that Venice can graph is the
advance/decline indicator. You can graph this indicator by:</para>

<list><item>Clicking on <highlight>Graph</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Market Indicator</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Advance/Decline</highlight> menu item.
</item>
</list>
<para>This operation reads in almost all of the available stock quotes, so it may take a while.</para>

<para>The advance/decline indicator is calculated by taking an arbitrary start value
(currently 0). Each day's value is calculated by taking the number of stocks
that advanced (i.e. have a higher day close than day open) minus the number of
stocks that declined and adding that to the previous day's value. This creates
a cumulative graph whose trend may be used to give an indication of possible
future direction of the market.</para>
</section>
</section>

<section name="Stock Charts">

 <para>Venice supports a variety of technical charts. Some of these charts are
described below, for the others, please consult the literature for their
meaning and interpretation.</para>

<section name="Custom">
<para>Venice supports the charting of user-defined custom indicators. Using the
<link to="Gondola Language">Gondola Language</link> you can write custom indicators which can
then be charted. The custom chart user interface allows you to enter a Gondola
equation to chart and to specify the chart as either primary or secondary.
A primary chart is one that appears in the top graph. A secondary chart will
appear in its own smaller graph below.</para>
</section>

<section name="Point And Figure">
  <para>The Point and Figure graph attempts to highligh only significant price movement, independant of time. This means it differs from most of the other charts in that there is not necessarily any data shown for a particular date range. </para>

<para>
If you switch to the Point and Figure graph while zoomed in on an area which does not have any Point and Figure data or you attempt to zoom in on such an area, a warning dialogue is displayed and the operation will be cancelled.
</para>

</section>

 <section name="Fibonacci Charts">
   <para>The Fibonacci Retracement Chart is used to estimate possible support and resistence levels between two price levels. This indicator draws horizontal lines at levels corresponding to the following Fibonacci Ratios: 0%, 23.6%, 38.2% , 50.0%, 61.8%, 78.6%, 100%</para>   

   <para>The Fibonacci Chart takes two parameters:
     <list>
       <item>0% Level: Minimum price point for the indicator</item>
       <item>100% Level: Maximum price point for the indicator</item>
     </list>     
   </para>   
 </section>

 <section name="Adjusting the chart for Splits and Dividends">
   <para>If your data source doesn't automatically adjust your data for dividends or splits, you may wish to display the chart as if no split or dividend occurred. Or alternatively, you can display the chart as if the split happnened when the stock listed. You would want to do because indicators may be misleading Gondola rules may trigger unexpectedly. </para>

   <para>To adjust the chart for a split or a dividend, select the 'Adjust Chart for Split/Dividend' menu item, which can be found in the chart window, under the menu of the stock being graphed. </para>

   <para>An "Adjust Data" dialog appears with the following fields:
     <list>
       <item>Adjustment Type (Dividend or Split)</item>
       <item>Direction (forward/backwards)</item>
       <item>Date - The date the split or dividend occurred</item>
       <item>Ratio or Value - The amount of the dividend or the ratio of the split</item>
     </list>          
   </para>

   <para>For the direction field, choose forward if you want to display the chart as if the dividend or split hadn't occurred. Choose backwards if you want to display the chart as if the change had always occurred. </para>

   <para>Enter the details of the split or adjustment and press OK. The chart will redraw itself and display the chart according to the change. </para>

   <para>To apply a reverse split of say one for two, you would enter 0.5 in the ratio field. </para>

   </section>

<section name="Chart Functions">
  <para>The graph functions are accessed via the toolbar which is created on the left of the chart by default. The functions are:  </para>

    <para>The "Zoom in" function will zoom in on a selected area, where as "Zoom out" always returns to the intial setting, regardless of how many times the user zooms in.</para>
  </section>

  <section name="Chart Drawing">
    <para>The chart drawing functions allow the user to draw lines and add text to a chart in a fairly basic manner. Any lines drawn on a chart scale with the zoom level. </para>
  </section>
  
  <section name="Others">
    <para>The "Clone" button opens a window with the same chart type.</para>
    <para>The "Flip chart" button toggles the orientation of the chart. The initial orientation is for the origin of the chart to be in the top left hand corner. Therefore, pressing the button twice returns the chart to it's original position. </para>    
  </section>

  <section name="Chart Cursor">
    <para>When you hover the mouse over a graph region, a tooltip appears showing the quote value under the pointer. If however you require a more immediate or accurate view of the data, Venice can display a cursor on the chart. </para>
    <para>Enable the cursor by selecting 'Enable/Disable Chart Cursor' in the Graph menu. When you enable the cursor, it is drawn on the chart, and table opens up with a row selected which corresponds to the cursors location on the chart. </para>
    <para>When you select a different row, the cursor will appear at that location on the chart. When you move the cursor on the chart (using the mouse), the table will select the row which corresponds to the cursor's new location.</para>

</chapter>

<chapter name="Gondola Language">
<para>The <highlight>Gondola Language</highlight> is a language for analysing stock market data.
The language allows you to do a variety of tasks from listing stocks in tables
that only match your criteria to creating automated buy/sell paper trade rules.
The language is closely modelled after the C programming language, so if you
know that language, then you should find Gondola easy and familliar to
work with.
</para>

<para>Whenever you enter a Gondola expression there are two implicit variables that
are always set: the current date and the current stock. For example if
you are displaying a <link to="Tables">Table</link> of stock quotes, you can execute an
equation for each stock. If you entered this line:</para>

<para><code>avg(close, 30)</code></para>

<para>It would display, for each stock, the average day close value over the last
30 days starting from today. Here the current date would be set to the most
recent day you have a quote for and the current stock would be set to the
current stock.</para>

<para>You can also enter equations when performing <link to="Analysis">Paper Trading</link>. If you
entered the following as a buy rule:</para>

<para><code>avg(close, 15) &gt; avg(close, 30, -1)</code></para>

<para>It would only buy the stock when the average day close over the last 15 days
was higher than the average day close of over the last 30 days, where the
30 day average would be calculated starting from the previous day and working
backwards. So here the current date would be set to whatever date the trade
was to be analysed for.</para>

<para>The Gondola language is very type strict. What this means is that each value
has a given type, whether it is an <highlight>integer</highlight>, <highlight>real</highlight> or <highlight>boolean</highlight>. This means
that the numbers <code>12</code> and <code>12.0</code> are different, and <code>1</code> and <code>true</code>
are different. If you get a type mismatch error, you've probably entered an
<highlight>integer</highlight> number (e.g. <code>12</code>) instead of a <highlight>real</highlight> number (e.g. <code>12.0</code>).</para>

<section name="Gondola Operators">
<para>The Gondola language supports the following boolean operators: <highlight>and</highlight>, <highlight>or</highlight>
and <highlight>not</highlight>. For example:</para>

<list><item><code>close &gt; 12.0 or open &gt; 12.0
</code></item>
<item><code>close &gt; 12.0 and open &gt; 12.0
</code></item>
<item><code>not(avg(open, 15) &gt; 12.0)
</code></item>
</list>

<para>It also supports basic arithmetic: +, -, * and /. For example:</para>
<list><item><code>close + lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close - lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close / lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close * lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
</list>

<para>Note that Gondola expects the binary operands (that is the above +, 0, * and /) to be grouped in pairs. Therefore, if you have an expression like A + B +C, it must be grouped into two pairs, using paranethesis. In the example above, that would either (A + B) + C, or A + (B + C)</para>

<para>The type of the returned value is determined by the operands, with floating point types having precedence. The type determinations changed as of version 0.72. Prior to this version, the type of an expression was determined by the type of the first operand. 

The following examples explain the behaviour:</para>
<list><item>INTEGER_TYPE + INTEGER_TYPE returns an INTEGER_TYPE</item>
<item>INTEGER_TYPE - FLOAT_TYPE returns a FLOAT_TYPE</item>
<item>FLOAT_TYPE - INTEGER_TYPE returns a FLOAT_TYPE</item>
<item>FLOAT_TYPE / INTEGER_TYPE returns a FLOAT_TYPE</item>
<item>FLOAT_TYPE * FLOAT_TYPE returns a FLOAT_TYPE</item>
</list>

<para>And finally it also supports the relational operators: <highlight>==</highlight>, <highlight>&gt;</highlight>, <highlight>&gt;=</highlight>, <highlight>&lt;</highlight>,
<highlight>&lt;=</highlight> and <highlight>!=</highlight>. For example:</para>
<list><item><code>volume == lag(volume, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close &gt; lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close &gt;= lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close &lt; lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>close &lt;= lag(close, -1)
</code></item>
<item><code>volume != lag(volume, -1)
</code></item>
</list>
</section>

<section name="Gondola Comments">
<para>You can add comments to your rule definitions which are ignored by Venice. Comments are enclosed by pairs of "/*" and "*/" strings. </para>
<para>For example in the rule: </para><para><code>/* Buy if the close is higher than yesterdays close */ close &gt; lag(close, -1). </code></para>
<para>the comment is "Buy if the close is higher than yesterdays close" and will be ignored. Unlike the C language, comments can be nested.  </para>
</section>


<section name="Gondola Variables">
<para>The Gondola language has full support for variables, which allow you to
store, retrieve and manipulate values. When defining a new variable you
need to specify whether the variable can change or is constant, the variable
type, the name of the variable and optionally the initial value of the
variable.</para>
<para>Examples:</para>
<list><item><code>int averageValue
</code></item>
<item><code>const boolean myValue = true
</code></item>
<item><code>float averageValue = 10.0*12.0
</code></item>
</list>
</section>

<section name="Gondola User Defined Functions">
<para>In addition to tbe built in functions listed below, the Gondola langauage supports functions written by the user. Defining a function is similar to defining a variable - the return type and the type of any parameters must be specified. Additionally, the keyword "function" is appended after the type definition.</para>
<para>For Example: </para>
<para><code>int function factorialFunction(int n) </code> </para>
<para>defines a function returning an integer value, and takes one integer parameter "n". The body of the function has the same properties as a for or while loop in that it is the last line in the expression which is the return value. Note that the type of the return value must match the function definition. A warning on returning from functions: Gondola does not have a line separator (e.g. ";") and you may have unexpected results when you try to write a function like this: <para>
<code>int function returnSomeInteger() { <linebreak/>
 float tmpFloat = returnSomeFloat()  <linebreak/>
 -returnSomeInt2() <linebreak/>
} 
</code></para>
<para> This will return a type mismatch because the last line actually is: <code> float tmpFloat = returnSomeFloat() - returnSomeInt2() </code>. </para>
</para>
<para>Variables can be defined inside functions. However, their scope will persist when the function call ends, because Gondola is not stack based at this time. Similarly, declared parameters remain in scope as well. However, variables which are declared in an included rule will not be in scope. See the following section "Including External Rules" for more details.</para>
</section>

<section name="Including External Rules">
<para>You can nest rules within another using the "include" mechanism:</para>
<para><code>include "RULENAME"</code></para>
<para>Where RULENAME is the name of the rule. Note that the name must be encased in quotes, otherwise Venice will attempt to resolve RULENAME as a variable.</para>
<para>Any variables which are defined in the included rule will not be available, However, user defined functions in included rules are available.</para>
</section>

<section name="Gondola Functions">
<section name="Absolute Value">
<para>The absoluate value function returns the absolute value of the given value.
The absolute value is the positive value of a number. For example the absolute
value of -12 is 12, and the absolute value of 12 is 12.</para>
<para><code>abs(VALUE)</code></para>
<para>Where VALUE is the initial value.</para>
<para>Example:</para>
<para><code>abs(-28.0)</code></para>
<para>Returns the absolute value of -28.0 which is 28.0.</para>
</section>

<section name="Alert">
  <para>The alert function displays a message on the screen. The purpose of this function is to aid rule debugging and always returns 0.0. <emphasis>Note: When this function is evaluated, it will pause execution!</emphasis> Also note that the alert will display for every date in the range. So if you have 30 days data in the range, you may end up with 20 alert messages appearing, all of which have to be dismissed before execution can continue.</para>
  <para><code>alert(STRING, [ argument2 ], [ argument3 ], [ argument4 ])</code></para>
  <para>Where STRING is an expression or a string, and the optional arguments argument2 - argument4 are also expressions or strings. The value of the optional parameters is appended to the output message. </para> 
  <para>Example:</para>
  <para><code>float mesg1 = alert("Days held = ", held, "stock capital = ", stockcapital)</code></para> 
  <para>Displays the following message: "Days held = held, stock capital = stockcaptial", with the values for held and stockcapital displayed respectively. The variable mesg1 will contain the value 0.0.</para>

<para><code>for(INITIAL; CONDITION; LOOP) { COMMAND }</code></para>
<para>The function will execute the INITIAL expression, then execute
the COMMAND expression, and then execute the LOOP expression. It will
then execute the CONDITION expression. If the CONDITION expression
was FALSE then the function will return. Otherwise it will run the
COMMAND expression, then the LOOP expression, then check the CONDITION
expression, etc.</para>
<para>Example:</para>
<para><codeblock>int b = 0

for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 1) {

<chapter name="Paper Trade">
<para>Venice allows you to perform historical paper trading, which allows you to test
buy/sell rules using historical share data. You need to enter basic data such
as which shares you wish to trade (either from a select list or say all
ordinary shares), the buy/sell rules you wish to trigger the trades, the date
range over which to trade, and the initial capital. Venice will then pretend
to buy and sell shares over that time range and will generate a portfolio
detailing all its trades and the final portfolio value. You can bring up
the paper trade dialogue by:</para>
<list><item>Clicking on the <highlight>Analysis</highlight> menu item.
</item>
<item>Then clicking on the <highlight>Paper Trade</highlight> menu item.
</item>
</list>

<para>The screenshots below represent the simplest use case and the minimum settings required to use the paper trade functionality.</para>

<section name="The Range Page">
<para>The range page defines the range and order of the paper trade. The
<highlight>Date Range</highlight> defines the range of dates that the paper trade will be
active. The <highlight>Symbols</highlight> field defines which symbols the paper trade will be
restricted to. You can either use the set groups such as <highlight>All Ordinaries</highlight>
or you can enter any specific set of symbols. For each day that the paper
trade runs, it will iterate through all the symbols it is allowed to
trade. For each symbol, it will run the buy rule to see if it triggers a
trade. If the paper trade has no more money left to purchase shares for
that day, it will move to the next day. If you want to control the order
that the paper trade iterates through the symbols, you can using the
<highlight>Order Symbols</highlight> options. You can either order the
symbols by the given options, or by entering an equation.</para>
<para>Some example values:</para>
<list><item>Start Date: 3/1/2000

<item>End Date: 24/1/2001
</item>
<item>Symbols: ANZ WBC CBA NAB

</item>
</list>
<para>In the example above, Venice will operate over all the symbols ANZ, WBC, CBA and NAB on all the trading days between 3/1/2000 and 24/1/2001 inclusive. It will sort the stocks in the descending order of volatility. </para>

</section>
<section name="The Rules Page">
<para>The rules page defines the buy/sell rules that trigger trades. Venice
supports the concept of <highlight>Rule Families</highlight>. The idea is that you
might want to try several hundred very similar equations.
For example, if you wanted to trigger a buy on a moving average, you might
have the following buy equation:
<code>avg(close, 15, 0) > avg(close, 30, 0)</code>. But what if you wanted
to try not only 15 and 30, but all the values up to 100? You could do this
by entering the equation: <code>avg(close, a, 0) > avg(close, b, 0)</code>.
Then making sure the <highlight>Enable multiple rules</highlight> checkbox is ticked.
Then entering the maximum values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> into the <highlight>Range</highlight> entries.</para>
<para>Venice makes additional variables available to paper trade equations:</para>
<list><item><code>daysfromstart</code> - defines the number of days that has been passed
      from the beginning of the paper trade. For example in the 10th day of trade daysfromstart is equal to 10.
</item>
<item><code>daysfromlastransaction</code> - defines the number of days that have passed since the last transaction (buy or sell)</item>
<item><code>capital</code> - defines the capital of the portfolio calculated
      from the beginning of the paper trade. It is a float number.
</item>
<item><code>held</code> - defines the number of days that the stock has been
      held.
</item>
<item><code>order</code> - if you selected any order besides <highlight>No Real Order</highlight> this variable
      will be available. It will be set to the order that the symbol is
      analysed by the paper trade. If it is the first symbol analysed, then
      <code>order</code> will be set to 0. For example, if you are ordering
      by volume decreasing, the stock with the highest volume will be
      analysed first, and the <code>order</code> variable will be set to 0.
</item>
<item><code>stockcapital</code> - defines the capital of the stock calculated
      from when the stock has been bought.
      If the stock is not held stockcapital is equal to 0.0. It is a float number.
</item>
<item><code>transactions</code> - defines the number of transactions done from the beginning of the paper trade.
</item>
</list>
<para>Some example values:</para>
<list><item>Buy Rule: <code>order == 0
</code></item>
<item>Sell Rule: <code>order &lt; a || held &gt; b
</code></item>
<item>Enable multiple rules: Ticked
</item>
<item>Range a: 1 to: 10

</section>
<section name="The Portfolio Page">
<para>The portfolio page defines the portfolio that is used when paper trading. You
need to enter the <highlight>initial capital</highlight> that the portfolio has before it starts
trading, and a value for a fixed <highlight>Trade Cost</highlight>.
Next you need to decide how many stocks the portfolio can contain. You
can specify either a fixed <highlight>Number of Stocks</highlight>, in which case Venice works out
the average value of each stock. Or you can specify the <highlight>Stock Value</highlight>, in which
case Venice works out the maximum number of stocks.</para>
<para>Some example values:</para>
<list><item>Initial Capital: 400000

<item>Trade Cost: 25

</section>
<section name="The Trade Value Page">
<para>The trade value page defines the strategy used to buy or sell the stocks. You
need to enter an <highlight>equation for buying</highlight> and <highlight>another for selling</highlight>;
if you prefer you can use the suggested equations instead, you can do that selecting one of the equations in the combo box.
The equation gives to the system the value at which you buy or sell the stock the next day.
The rules, in the Rules Page section, give you if you buy or sell the stock the next day,
while the equations, in the Trade Value Page section, give you the fixed price at which you wish to buy or sell the stock the next day.
The combo box has the following selectable options:
open value of tomorrow (in Gondola: open),
close value (in Gondola: close),
an average value between maximum and minimum values (in Gondola: (low+high)/2.0),
an average value between open and close values (in Gondola: (open+close)/2.0),
the minimum value (in Gondola: low),
the maximum value (in Gondola: high).
Pay attention to the 'open' key word: if you put 'open' alone, you will buy or sell the stocks at open price the next day;
if you put 'lag(open,0)', you will buy or sell the stocks at a price equal to the open price of the day before and only if this price will be reached by the stock during the next day.</para>

<chapter name="Genetic Programming">
<para>Venice supports using evolutionary computation to create new buy/sell rules
based on historical data. The default way it works is that Venice initially creates a
set of random buy/sell rule equations. A pair of buy/sell rule equations is
refered to as an individual. It will then use algebraic simplification
to reduce the size of the individual's equations and also to remove any
unecessary computation. It will then check the individual's equations using a
few simple rules, e.g. is the equation big enough to be meaningful?
Is the equation not too large? If the individual's equations look like they
could be meaningful, it will paper trade with them, in the same method as the
<link to="Paper Trade">Paper Trade Module</link>. If the individual makes a loss or beaks even,
then it will be immediately rejected.</para>

<para>Once Venice has created a set of these random individuals, it will then
move onto the second generation. For this generation it will pick two
random individuals (with a strong bias to the better performing individuals)
and combine them, using a combination of cross-over and mutation, to create
a new individual. This process is refered to as breeding. It will again apply
algebraic simplification to the resultant individual's equations. It will
then paper trade this new individual. If the new individual has a greater
return than any of the previous individuals, it will be recorded. Venice will
then repeat this process, creating several new individuals. The number of
individuals created is refered to as the popluation. The number of the
highest returning individuals created which are bred in the next generation,
is refered to as the breeding population.</para>

<para>Once a given number of individuals have been created, Venice will then move
onto the third generation. Here, it is the same as the second generation,
except that instead of breeding from the random individuals that were
initially created, it will breed from individuals created that were bred
from the random individuals. Each generation then breeds from the
individuals bred from the last generation.</para>

<para>While equations created from Genetic Programming can give fantastic
returns on historical data, they unfortunately do not transfer directly to
different date and symbol ranges, than the ones that they were created with.
However, it is an experimental technique to see whether they can actually
come up with any principles that can be generally applied.</para>

to run, the <highlight>Population</highlight> size, the <highlight>Breeding Population</highlight> size,
the <highlight>Display Population</highlight> size and the <highlight>Window Size</highlight>.
The display population is the number of highest returning individuals that are
displayed when that generation has completed. The Window Size is the maximum
number of quote days that an individual will be able to base its buy/sell
evaluation on.

<section name="The Initial Population Page">
<para>In the initial population page you can set many buy/sell rules as you wish.
For each of them you need to specify the percentage that it will be used to generate
the first population of GP algorithm.
You can set <highlight>Percentage of Random Population</highlight>,
it is used to know the probability to generate a random individual, during the first
step of GP algorithm;
you can set <highlight>Percentage of Initial Population</highlight>,
it is used to know the probability to generate an individual got from user defined ones,
during the first step of GP algorithm;
you can set <highlight>Number of Mutations</highlight>,
it is the number of mutations that will be applied to the user defined individuals.
You can click two buttons: the former can be clicked to calculate the values
so that their sum is 100%, the latter can be clicked to set all the tabbed pane values
to the default. Normal behaviour should be: put values as you like, then click on
the former button to transform the inserted values to percentages.</para>

<para>The GP algorithm will generate the first population in this way:
it will choose between a random individual and an individual got from user defined ones,
this is done in accordance with the two values
<highlight>Percentage of Random Population</highlight>
and <highlight>Percentage of Initial Population</highlight>;
then if a user defined is choosen, it will be applied on it a number of mutations
equal to <highlight>Number of Mutations</highlight>;
then if the individual is not fine for breeding,
other mutations will be done until it is.

<section name="The GP Language Page">
<para>The Genetic Programme (GP) Language page defines the Gondola settings.
Currently you can set the probabilities for each word of Gondola. So the random
GP algorithm will choose the words in accordance with user defined probabilities.
If you set any of these values to zero, the GP algorithm will work without considering
this word as a Gondola language's word.</para>

<para>To make the selection easy, there are some selectable tabbed panes.
Each of them has two buttons: the former can be clicked to calculate the values
so that their sum is 100%, the latter can be clicked to set all the tabbed pane values
to the default. Normal behaviour should be: put values as you like, then click on
the former button to transform the inserted values to percentages.</para>

</chapter>

<chapter name="Genetic Algorithm">
<para>Genetic Algorithm is similar to <link to="Genetic Programming">Genetic Programming Module</link>.
It differs from Genetic Programming in that you have to write a buy and a sell rule with as many parameters as you wish, and declare the minimum and the maximum values for each parameter.
If you use minimum and maximum values of float type (2.3, 1.7, 1.1, ...) you'll use that parameter as float,
but be aware you need to put it in the rules so that it doesn't generate a syntax error.
If you use minimum and maximum values of integer type (2, 3, 4, ...) you'll use that parameter as integer,
but be aware to put it in the rules so that it doesn't generate a syntax error.
The Genetic Algorithm process will modifiy the parameter values inside the rules,
according to the range inserted.</para>

<para>A frequently asked question is the following: I've tried the genetic algorithm, but it doesn't work,
is unable to finish or it stops after having found just some solutions.
The genetic algorithm doesn't assure completion and sometimes a solution cannot be found. The only hint that can be given is choosing the buy and sell rules the best you can,
so that the genetic algorithm can find a solution more easily, assuming it exists!
The following sections show you two examples which may be of help.</para>

<section name="RSI Example">
<para>A simple example is to use the following rules: buy rule: <code>rsi(14)&lt;32.0 + paramBuy</code>,
sell rule: <code>rsi(14)>72.0 + paramSell</code>. If you set paramBuy and paramSell with values changing from 0.0 to 1.0,
you may find good solutions to the most of the trading periods. Pay attention to the parameters' setting:
In this example we've set the parameters as float, otherwise set as integer you would have had only few solutions (4):
(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), and the algorithm could not work properly.</para>
</section>

<section name="Neural Network Example">
<para>A more complex but interesting example are the artificial neural networks.
If you do not know anything about neural networks you can look at the Joone project on sourceforge.
Here you can find just an example of neural networks, where the weights are from the genetic selection of the
genetic algorithm. This is the only thing that can be done in genetic algorithm analysis section.
For the sake of simplicity we use the sigmoid function, so the neuron is modelled by the Gondola expression:
<code>(1.0/(1.0+exp(-1.0*input)))</code>.
The neurons are input for the hidden layer through the synapses, so each hidden layer will be 
<code>((v11*inputneuron1 + ... ) + v1n*inputneuronn)</code>.
The same process can be applied for the output layer.
At the end you obtain one output neuron for the buy rule and one for the sell rule that can be used
in Venice.</para>

<para>If you want a quick couple of rules, I give you the rules that represent two artificial neural networks of
4 input neurons and 6 hidden neurons and 1 output neuron.
The first neural network can be used for the buy rule, the second for the sell rule.
The input are open, close, high and low, but you can modify as you like as soon as you've practised with
that expressions.
The parameters that you have to set are: v11 .. v64 (24 parameters), w11 .. w16 (6 parameters),
y11 .. y64 (24 parameters), z11 .. z16 (6 parameters). I put them ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.</para>

<chapter name="Artificial Neural Network">
<para>Venice is able to use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for technical analysis.
Venice can be used standalone, but the best performance is achieved using it together with Joone,
you can download Joone from http://www.jooneworld.com/.
You can use the ANN in two ways. You can use the default ANN, that is to say you use Venice standalone:
a default ANN will be created with a Linear Layer as input, and a Sigmoid Layer as hidden and another
Sigmoid Layer as output.
You can use a custom ANN, that is to say you use Venice together with Joone; the custom ANN can be imported from
the file system. All accepted files are .snet and .xml formats, which can be obtained by exporting any ANN from Joone.
When you export an ANN from Joone, make sure the ANN has the right number of input and
output neurons. The number of input neurons must be equal to the input expressions defined in ANN I/O Params section,
the number of output neurons must be equal to two (buy and sell signals). If you import an ANN
which have a different number of input/output neurons, before running or training it, the system will ask
you to resize automatically the input/output neurons to the correct number.
The ANN is not saved in the preferences. So when you open the ANN window, you have no ANN in memory. The only
choice available is to build a new one using the default model or to load an existing one from the file system.
When you close the ANN window, be sure to save the ANN, because the ANN is not automatically saved
in the preferences. If the ANN has not been saved, the system will ask you to save it.</para>

<para>Another interesting point is how we can get the output buy and sell signals from the ANN.
The theory (Cross Target technique, by Prof. Pietro Terna) that resolves this problem can be seen 
Alat the following internet site:
http://web.econ.unito.it/terna/ct-era/ct-era.html
You must think about the above technique in the following way: the actions are buy and sell signals; the effect of the actions is the capital.
For the sake of simplicity we have not put the capital as output of the ANN, so the ANN has only two
outputs: buy and sell signals; one buy and one sell used for all stocks, as usual in Venice.
We train the buy and sell signals according to cross target parameters.
We train a buy signal if in one of the days from the trading day to the last window forecast day
we can gain an amount equal to or higher than the earning percentage.
For example if we have window forecast = 7 and earning percentage = 2.0, we look for the next 7 days trading. 
If in at least one of those days, gain equal to or greater than 2% is made, the ANN will be trained
with a buy signal. If the gain is less than 2%, the ANN will be trained with a sell signal.</para>

<para>This is the same as the trade value page in the <link to="Paper Trade">Paper Trade Module</link>.</para>
</section>

<section name="ANN I/O Params">
<para>Here you can add/modify/delete input expressions. At least one expression must be added. These expressions must be valid Gondola expressions where an integer or double value is returned; do not add equations (where a boolean value is returned). 

The input expressions will be the input values for ANN during running and training. The order of input expressions
will be the same as the order of Joone input neurons.
Pay attention to what kind of input you put, because if the inputs are wrong the CT method will not work well.
For example if you want to trade with 20 stocks (instead of  one), you have to take into consideration that
an input expression of this kind: <code>ema(close, 30)</code>. This has the following problems:
It depends on very different values due to stock diversity, so normalization has to occur somehow;
The default network must have large positive and negative numbers, so that
tiny differences in the historical data can be easily learned by the ANN. 

Therefore, a better input expression
might be the following one: <code>1000*((ema(close,50)-close)/close)</code>.
You can define also the thresholds for buy and sell signals. The threshold is the value that defines the firing of
output neurons, so for example if the ANN has a output buy signal of 0.7, and a threshold for buy signal of 0.5,
the ANN will buy, but if we have a threshold of 0.8 and the same output buy signal (0.7), the ANN won't buy.
If one wants to have more or less transactions, the threshold values can be changed. With high value thresholds
ANN will buy and sell rarely, with low value thresholds ANN will buy and sell more often.</para>

<para>Some example values:</para>
<list><item>Buy Threshold: 0.5
</item>
<item>Sell Threshold: 0.5
</item>
</list>
</section>

<section name="ANN Training">
<para>Here you can define all the training and cross target parameters. The learning rate and momentum
are parameters of ANN, (further details are availble in the Joone documentation). Both values must be between 0.0 and 1.0. The pre learning patterns are the patterns which are not considered
while training. For example we train the ANN with 10 stocks for 20 days (10 patterns per day), if we want to skip 3 days of training, we set pre learning to 30 ( 3 days x 10 stocks = 30).

The default pre learning is zero, so all the periods selected in the Venice GUI are taken into consideration.
The 'tot cycles' are the number of training cycles. Having many training cycles slows the training session, but
the ANN will have better performance once trained. The earning percentage and the window forecast are
the Cross Target parameters, as described above in the Artificial Neural Network introduction.</para>

<para>Some example values:</para>
<list><item>Learning Rate: 0.7
</item>
<item>Momentum: 0.5
</item>
<item>Pre Learning: 0

<section name="ANN Type">
<para>Here you can load/save ANN from/to file system. You can also decide to use a default ANN or a custom one.
If you decide to use a custom ANN, you will have to load it from the file system.</para>
</section>

<section name="ANN Example">
<para>Almost all the parameters have default values, so we'll give you just an example of input values for the input
expressions of the ANN. Another important thing is to consider the stocks, because the trend
can vary a lot from one stock to another. Training one neural network for one stock only is the way to achieve the best performance. If you want to train and run the ANN with more than one stock in the stock
text box, choose the bundle of stocks carefully, because the system manages only one neural network with two output signals for all the stocks in the bundle.</para>
<para>Example of input values of input expressions of the ANN:</para>
